# admin-page

I can say for certain that this is the worst project that I have completed. In doing so I think that there is a lot of things that I learned from doing this
particular assignment. I also realize I forgot the drop shadows on some of the elements.

CSS styling: I realized that I was reusing a lot of styles about 60% of the way through the project. I think that the method that is most effective it to
divide things into 2 general areas, specific styles and generic styles. In specific, it would be like the layout of the page or the project div layouts, or which row
and column to start on. The generic styles is like bold font or padding. The probable rule of thumb is that if you are styling something, it should have at most 1
specific styling on it and then as many generics. Instead of pushing all of the burnden onto the css, the html should hold more classes. I think the one thing that I
did do correctly in this regard is the filter for the svgs turning them into white, instead of unilaterally giving the sidebar > img a filter styling.

CSS Grid Layout: I should have been more careful on how I initially started lining up my grid rows and columns. First I will say that I think that the Your Projects
section looks really good, and I definitely feel like I really knocked that section out of the park. However getting that section to line up nicely with the annoucements section is something that I'm not sure I as supposed to accomplish, especially how nicely it seems to align with the "your projects" section.
Instead of separating the grey area into 2 parts, I think a more elaborate grid was used. Also whether to wrap the annoucements and trending into one div or leave them separate. Or whether to wrap the annoucements title with the actual announcements. My next thing that I would probably try is making a 2d grid, something like
column: 4fr 2fr and row: 1fr 3fr 1fr 3fr, and let the projects grid span 3 rows and weave title, section, title, section in the 2nd column.

Overall: I would give myself a C+ or B-, I think once I am more adjusted into using row and grid I will comeback and see if I can knock this one out.
